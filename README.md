# Subtensor

The Bittensor monorepo. It contains the **subtensor** chain (a Substrate-based
blockchain), the **Python SDK and `btcli`**, the **documentation**, and the
**website** that renders it — all in one place so a single change can be
validated end-to-end before it ships.

**Full documentation:** [bittensor.com/docs](https://bittensor.com/docs)

That site is the source of truth for using Bittensor: install, wallets,
staking, subnets, EVM, every transaction and query, error codes, and
contributor guides. The markdown lives in [`docs/`](./docs/) and is published
by [`website/`](./website/).

## What Bittensor is

Bittensor is an open network where independent **subnets** produce digital
commodities — compute, inference, storage, prediction — and the chain pays
participants in **TAO** in proportion to the value they contribute. **Miners**
produce, **validators** score, **subnet owners** define incentive mechanisms,
and **stakers** back validators.

The **subtensor** chain is the trust layer: it runs consensus, records subnet
and neuron state, handles staking and emissions, and moves value. Work itself
happens off-chain inside subnets; the chain coordinates and pays for it.
Subtensor also exposes a full **EVM** (Frontier) and **ink!/wasm** smart
contracts alongside native Substrate extrinsics.

## What's in this repo

| Area | Path | What it is |
|------|------|------------|
| Chain runtime | [`pallets/`](./pallets/), [`runtime/`](./runtime/) | FRAME pallets and the composed runtime. `pallets/subtensor/` is the core (staking, subnets, emissions, weights). |
| Node | [`node/`](./node/) | The `node-subtensor` binary: networking, RPC, chain specs. |
| EVM | [`precompiles/`](./precompiles/) | Precompiles that expose substrate functionality to EVM contracts. |
| Wasm contracts | [`chain-extensions/`](./chain-extensions/), [`ink-contract/`](./ink-contract/) | Chain extensions and ink! contract sources. |
| Shared Rust | [`common/`](./common/), [`primitives/`](./primitives/), [`support/`](./support/) | Shared types, math primitives, lints, macros, weight tooling. |
| Client core | [`sdk/bittensor-core/`](./sdk/bittensor-core/) | The Rust core for Bittensor clients (keypairs, keyfiles, SCALE codec, extrinsic assembly, RFC-0078 digest, drand timelock, ML-KEM) — built against the same crate revisions as the chain; Python bindings in [`sdk/bittensor-core-py/`](./sdk/bittensor-core-py/). |
| Python SDK | [`sdk/python/`](./sdk/python/) | The `bittensor` package and `btcli` CLI. Generated from chain metadata so reads, writes, and docs cannot drift. |
| Documentation | [`docs/`](./docs/) | Source for bittensor.com/docs. `docs/tx/`, `docs/query/`, and `docs/errors/` are generated — do not hand-edit. |
| Website | [`website/`](./website/) | Yarn + Turbo monorepo; `apps/bittensor-website` renders marketing pages and these docs. |
| Tests | [`ts-tests/`](./ts-tests/), [`clones/`](./clones/), [`eco-tests/`](./eco-tests/) | Moonwall/zombienet integration tests, mainnet-clone regression harness, indexer contract tests. |
| Operations | [`chainspecs/`](./chainspecs/), [`scripts/`](./scripts/), [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) | Chain specs, CI/dev scripts, production and localnet Docker images. |

## How the monorepo fits together

A runtime change can break the SDK, the docs, or live mainnet state. This
repo keeps those surfaces in sync:

1. **Metadata-driven SDK.** The Python layer (`bittensor.storage`, `runtime_api`,
   `calls`, `constants`) is emitted from a node's runtime metadata. Hand-written
   **reads** and **intents** sit on top; the CLI (`btcli query …`, `btcli tx …`)
   is generated from the same registries. CI proves every chain call is either
   wrapped by an intent or explicitly marked raw-only.

2. **Docs generated from the same registries.** Transaction, query, and error
   reference pages in `docs/` are built from the SDK catalogs, so
   bittensor.com/docs always matches what `btcli` and `import bittensor` expose.

3. **CI validates the whole stack.** On every PR, Rust checks run alongside a
   [mainnet-clone upgrade](https://bittensor.com/docs/internals/mainnet-clone)
   (your runtime applied to a copy of live state), Python SDK suites, and a docs
   build. Runtime migrations are replayed with try-runtime.

4. **Release train.** Merging to `main` builds the runtime once (deterministic
   srtool build) and promotes it devnet → testnet → mainnet. The SDK and docs
   publish after the chain upgrade lands. See
   [Release process](https://bittensor.com/docs/internals/release-process).

### Minimal local chain (Docker)

```bash
docker run --rm --name local_chain \
  -p 9944:9944 -p 9945:9945 \
  ghcr.io/raofoundation/subtensor-localnet:devnet
```

Use `:testnet` for the commit deployed to testnet, `:mainnet` for the commit
running on mainnet, or `:main` for the current main-branch candidate;
`:latest` is an alias for `:main`. The `:devnet`, `:testnet`, and `:mainnet`
tags move only after that commit is verified on the corresponding live
network. Immutable `:sha-<commit>` and `:v<spec_version>` release tags are
also published for reproducible CI.

Then connect with `btcli --network local query is-fast-blocks` or
`bittensor.Client("local")`. See
[local development](https://bittensor.com/docs/guides/local-development)
for building from source, the Alice dev account, and faucet behavior.

### Minimal chain build (from source)

```bash
./scripts/init.sh        # Rust toolchain + wasm target
./scripts/localnet.sh    # build and launch a fast-blocks localnet
```

The node binary is `node-subtensor` (`cargo build --release` →
`./target/release/node-subtensor`). Extrinsic and query reference:
[Transactions](https://bittensor.com/docs/tx) ·
[Queries](https://bittensor.com/docs/query).

### Minimal SDK dev (from this repo)

```bash
cd sdk/python
just sync    # uv environment; builds bittensor-core from ../bittensor-core-py (in sdk/)
just check   # lint, typecheck, unit tests, codegen gates (same as CI)
```

Chain-facing SDK coverage lives in the Rust core e2e suite:
`cargo test -p bittensor-core --test e2e -- --nocapture`. See
[SDK tests](https://bittensor.com/docs/internals/sdk-tests).

- **Runtime** (`runtime/src/lib.rs`): composes pallets, defines
  `spec_version`, hosts migrations and runtime APIs.
- **Core pallet** (`pallets/subtensor/`): subnets, registration, staking,
  weights, emissions, delegates, commitments.
- **EVM**: Substrate accounts (ss58) and EVM accounts (h160) are separate
  signing domains on the same chain; precompiles bridge staking and balances
  into Solidity. Guide: [EVM](https://bittensor.com/docs/guides/evm).
- **Networks**: `finney` (mainnet), `test` (testnet), `local` (dev node).

## Contributing

Open PRs against `main`. Runtime-affecting changes need tests, a `spec_version`
bump (or the `no-spec-version-bump` label), and three positive reviews. Full
