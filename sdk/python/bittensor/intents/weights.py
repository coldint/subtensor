"""Weight-setting intents: adaptive set, timelock commit, and legacy reveal.

``SetWeights`` is the one entry point validators need: it accepts weights as a
``{uid: weight}`` mapping or parallel lists, conforms them to the subnet's
hyperparameters, preflights registration, the rate limit, and the weight
count, and dispatches to the plaintext or timelocked
commit-reveal extrinsic based on the subnet's on-chain configuration — so the
caller never has to know which regime the subnet runs.

``normalize`` (max-upscale + u16 quantize, dropping zeros) lives here as the one
canonical implementation and is re-exported from ``bittensor.intents``.

class RevealWeights(Intent):
    """Reveal previously committed weights (legacy salt-based commit-reveal).

    Completes the old two-step commit-reveal flow: the uids, weights, salt, and
    version key must hash to exactly what was committed earlier. The reveal is
    valid on exactly one epoch — the commit's epoch plus the subnet's reveal
    period; revealing earlier fails, and once that epoch has passed the commit
    is expired and dropped. The chain hashes the quantized u16 values, so the
    inputs here must be the same values passed at commit time (``build()``
    re-normalizes floats: identical proportions produce identical u16s).
    Signed by the hotkey that made the commit. Only needed for legacy
    salt-based commits — the timelocked path used by ``set_weights`` and
    ``commit_weights`` is auto-revealed by the chain and never needs this call.
