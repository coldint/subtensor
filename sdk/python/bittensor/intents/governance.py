    """Trim a subnet to at most ``max_n`` UIDs (subnet owner).

    Lowers the subnet's UID capacity and immediately deregisters the
    lowest-emission neurons above the new limit — those miners lose their
    slots and would have to re-register (paying the burn cost) to return.
    ``max_n`` must be between the chain's minimum allowed UIDs (64) and the
    subnet's current ``max_allowed_uids``. Owner-immune and temporally
    immune UIDs are skipped, and the call fails if immune UIDs would exceed
    80% of ``max_n``. Surviving UIDs are renumbered consecutively from
    zero, so UID values change. Rate-limited to once per 216,000 blocks
    (30 days) and blocked during the end-of-epoch admin freeze window.
    Owner-only and disruptive to affected participants, so announce it
    before shrinking a live subnet. To simply cap future growth without
    evicting anyone, set the ``max_allowed_uids`` hyperparameter to a value
    at or above the current UID count instead.

    For Null consensus, this legacy atomic operation can remove at most one
    pruning batch. Use ``TrimNullSubnetBatch`` repeatedly for a larger shrink.
