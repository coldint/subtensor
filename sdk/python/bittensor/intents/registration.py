    """Swap a hotkey for a new one (all subnets, or one netuid).

    Re-keys the neuron identity: the old hotkey's registrations, stake, and
    history move to ``new_hotkey_ss58``, either everywhere (``netuid`` omitted)
    or on a single subnet. The all-subnets swap recycles 0.1 TAO from the
    coldkey; the per-subnet swap recycles 0.001 TAO. Both respect a
    7,200-block (one day) per-(subnet, coldkey) cooldown — the all-subnets
    swap checks and records it on every subnet the old hotkey participates
    in. The old hotkey stops earning immediately, so update running
    miners/validators to sign with the new key at the same time. The new
    hotkey must not already be registered where the swap applies, so plan
    the change rather than iterating. This wraps the legacy ``swap_hotkey``
    extrinsic, deprecated on chain in favor of ``swap_hotkey_v2``;
    behavior is identical to ``swap_hotkey_v2`` with ``keep_stake=false``
    (stake moves to the new hotkey). This rotates a leaked hotkey without
    touching the coldkey; a compromised coldkey needs a coldkey swap
    instead.
