"""Subnet hyperparameter semantics: units, docs, and value conversion.

On chain, most hyperparameters are stored as raw fixed-point integers whose
meaning is invisible in the raw value: ``kappa 32767`` is really 0.5 of
``u16::MAX``, ``bonds_moving_avg 900000`` is 0.9 of 1,000,000, ``min_burn
700000000`` is τ0.7 in rao. This module is the single place that knows each
parameter's unit, so the CLI can render raw values with their normalized
meaning and accept either form when setting.

Conversion rules (see :func:`to_raw`): a plain integer is always the raw
on-chain value; a value with a decimal point is the human form — a 0..1
fraction for normalized parameters, a TAO amount for rao parameters.
