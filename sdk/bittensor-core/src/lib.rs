//! The chain-defined compute core and native Rust SDK for Bittensor clients.
//!
//! Rust owns the chain-defined pieces (crypto, SCALE, extrinsic payloads,
//! metadata digests) and now also exposes a thin native client and semantic
//! transaction executor over those primitives. Binding crates may reuse the
//! same client or expose only the compute surface to another language.
//!
//! See `sdk/bittensor-core-spec.md` for the full design.
